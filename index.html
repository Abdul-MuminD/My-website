    <h3>Overview of my school (UBIDS) </h3>
    <p>
        This university emerged from the former University for Development (UDS) Wa campus. The Simon Diedong Dombo University of Business and Integrated Development Studies (SDD-UBIDS) was 
        established in 2019 by an Act of Parliament (Act 1001) and came into being in May 2020 with its main campus in Bamahu, Wa.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Act (Act 1001, 2019) which establishes the Simon Diedong Dombo University of Business and Integrated Development Studies mandates it to be an outstanding internationally-acclaimed 
        applied research and practical-oriented educational institution dedicated to the development of business and integrated development studies and related matters.
        <br> 
        The history of the Simon Diedong Dombo University of Business and Integrated Development Studies is linked to that of the University for Development Studies (UDS), Tamale, through the
        Faculty of Integrated Development Studies (FIDS). The FIDS was the second faculty to be established by the University for Development Studies (UDS) in 1994. The Faculty started in borrowed 
        premises belonging to the School of Hygiene, Tamale (accommodation for students) and the Tamale Islamic Science Senior High School (Lecture space).
        <br>
        <br>
        The Faculty was relocated to Navrongo in 1995 where it was housed in another set of borrowed facilities formerly used by the Institute of Field Communication and Agricultural Training (IFCAT).
        The Faculty was again moved in 2002 to commence what was then known as the Wa Campus of the University for Development Studies (UDS) and now SDD-UBIDS.
